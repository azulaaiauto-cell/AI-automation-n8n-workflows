 Favour Okeke – AI Automation Workflows

This repository showcases some of my AI and automation workflows built with n8n, Make, and Botpress.

Projects
- Email Classifier Agent: Classifies incoming emails by topic and urgency using NLP.
- Scholarship Onboarding Agent:Automates applicant communication and onboarding.
- MarketingGenie Agent: Suggests marketing strategies based on user's input data.
- Lead Processor: Automates lead scraping, filtering, and organization into structured databases for faster, smarter decision-making.
- Customer Support NLP Chatbot: Provides intelligent, context-aware responses to customer inquiries using natural language processing.
- Cold Mailing Bot: Personalizes and automates cold outreach emails while tracking engagement and optimizing response rates.

Each workflow is exported from n8n as a `.json` file and can be imported back into any n8n instance.
